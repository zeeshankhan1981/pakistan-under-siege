### Jaffar Express Hijacking

On March 11, 2025, the Jaffar Express train, traveling from Quetta to Peshawar with over 400 passengers, was hijacked by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) in the Bolan Pass region. The militants detonated explosives on the tracks, causing derailment, and opened fire, resulting in a hostage crisis. The BLA demanded the release of Baloch political prisoners, threatening to execute hostages. A military operation, "Operation Green Bolan," was launched, leading to the rescue of 354 hostages and the death of 33 militants. However, the attack resulted in at least 64 fatalities, including civilians and security personnel. ​[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Jaffar_Express_hijacking?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
